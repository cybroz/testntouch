Yet i have not really a clear idea of what i am doing here.
I hate it to click here and there to find out finally simple function working.
Why i have no overview to my different versions in one board || how can i realize that?

One day searching out an operating system or a developers or other cloud will easy simple like game introductions are today.
.. or better: as easy as we learned roller blading or sailing a boat (with a mentor the basics, with focussed experiments the rest)
as easy we will come into the cybercloud to wich currently the (whole) human mind is (?un-fortunately) trying to migrate now.
